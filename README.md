# Employee Compensation in San Francisco

Our beloved city San Francisco is known to be one of the cities that has the highest cost of living in the world.

There are two main factors that have impact on the cost of living - income and housing. What we have here is a database of the salary and benefits paid to City employees between fiscal years 2013 - 2017 from The San Francisco Controller's Office.

One way to understand the progression is by looking at who it employs and how its employees are compensated. My goal here is to provide insights based on the job types we can find on this dataset.
